# cyber-range-emulator
A modular, Docker-based cyber-range environment designed for penetration testing, teaching, and research in network security. This emulator simulates a realistic multi-zone network—complete with attacker, victim, router, firewall, and monitoring nodes—using static IP segmentation across custom Docker bridge networks.
